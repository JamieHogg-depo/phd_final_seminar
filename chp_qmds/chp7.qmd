Improving spatial resolution
 - better models $=$ more high-resolution estimates of health (atlas platforms).
 - introduces the challenge of navigating decision making with multidimensional health information (with uncertainty)
 - given that decision paralysis can impede effective policy, only present essential information in an easily understandable manner
 - Australian Cancer Atlas great example of this
 - Chapter 5 presents our solution. 
Reliability
- health departments (report to policymakers) proving validity becomes increasingly important and complex; possibly made more difficult with the adoption of Bayesian models. 
- Chapter 6 compares estimates from Bayesian models with those from previous approaches: solid agreement. 
- Not always possible
- survey data, for example, the ultimate, but impractical, validation dataset would be health data for the entire population.

::: {.notes}
Theory/model

 - more rigorous theoretical foundation for two-stage approaches
 - include multivariate variations or including non-linear components such as splines and Gaussian processes. 
 
Validation for SAE

 - although new methodologies improve the reliability of small area estimates best approach - acquiring more survey data.
 - Three ways
	- expand the nationwide surveys conducted by the ABS. 
	- leveraging the existing health information collected annually and independently by each state and territory of Australia.
	- include questions about health behaviours in the census
	
Validation for burden of disease methods and models

 - the prevalence of disease states is simplistically assumed to be constant across time, areas, age, and sex
 - the definition of disease states in discrete terms fails to capture the nuanced dynamics of disease progression or regression.
 - accommodate the unique types of measurement error.
 
Indices

 - particularly if the modelled estimates or indices are intended to track the impact of health interventions. 
 - Temporal consistency requires consistency in the: survey design, questions and scope; region boundaries; and populations across time, which can be difficult to verify. 
 - temporal consistency must first be backed by a consistent, reproducible and robust methodology
 - This entails the selection of methods that are easy to use, validate and understand
 - Indices are extremely sensitive to the order, number and selection of features, the nature of the transformations used, and whether errors and spatial dependence are accommodated. 
 - the pervasive issue of the modifiable areal unit problem presents challenges in releasing indices at a variety of geographical levels
